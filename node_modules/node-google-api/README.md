# node-google-api

A Node.js module that simplifies the use of RESTful Google APIs.  API functions are formed through the Google APIs Discovery Service, so they are automagically up to date.

## How to Install

```bash
npm install node-google-api
```



## How to use

Calling `build` will generate either one or all of the APIs, returning one object that contains each API. Then just use the APIs according to their documention!

```js
var google = require('node-google-api')('<<YOUR GOOGLE API KEY>>');

google.build(function(api) {
	api.calendar.events.list({
		calendarId: 'en.usa#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com'
	}, function(events) {
		for(var e in events.items) {
			console.log(events[e].summary);
		}
	});
}
```

## Future Plans
<ul>
	<li>More flexible API loading</li>
	<li>User Authorization support</li>
	<li>Auto-loading of APIs</li>
</ul>
